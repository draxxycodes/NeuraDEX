# 🧠 NeuraDEX: Multi-Agent DeFi Portfolio Orchestrator

> **"Autonomous, explainable, and risk-aware DeFi portfolio management — powered by ASI Alliance, uAgents, and MeTTa reasoning."**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**NeuraDEX** is an **AI-driven, multi-agent DeFi portfolio orchestrator** designed for the **ASI Alliance track**.  
It unites **Fetch.ai’s uAgents**, **SingularityNET’s MeTTa symbolic reasoning**, and a **FastAPI backend** into one powerful, transparent, and autonomous ecosystem.

Through conversational AI and autonomous agents, NeuraDEX enables users to:
- 🧭 Analyze portfolio risk intelligently  
- 📈 Discover yield opportunities across chains  
- 🤖 Generate explainable execution proposals  
- 🧮 Reason symbolically using MeTTa for transparency

## 🧩 Core Architecture

### 🧠 AI/ML & Agent Layer (`/agents`)

| Agent | Role | Description |
|:------|:------|:-------------|
| **`risk_agent.py`** | Risk Analyzer | Evaluates volatility/liquidity using MeTTa symbolic reasoning |
| **`yield_agent.py`** | Yield Optimizer | Finds high-yield protocols for PYUSD and other assets |
| **`execution_agent.py`** | Executor | Simulates or prepares signed transaction proposals |
| **`coordinator_agent.py`** | Orchestrator | Coordinates all agents, ensuring consensus and response flow |

Agents communicate via **uAgents** and are compatible with the **ASI:One Chat Protocol** and **Agentverse** registry.

---

### ⚙️ Backend Layer (`/backend`)

Built using **FastAPI**, the backend:
- Serves as an **API gateway** between agents and frontend/UI  
- Simulates **transaction execution and validation**  
- Aggregates and returns portfolio and yield data  

**Endpoints**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:----------|:--------|:-------------|
| `/api/portfolio_summary` | `GET` | Returns portfolio composition, volatility, and liquidity |
| `/api/execute` | `POST` | Accepts execution proposals and simulates signing |

---

### 🧮 Reasoning Layer (`/metta_engine`)

Implements **symbolic reasoning** using **MeTTa (SingularityNET)**.

- `rules.json`: Symbolic rules for portfolio risk evaluation  
- `metta_shim.py`: Python ↔ MeTTa interface  
- `__init__.py`: Initialization and utilities  

**Example rule logic**
```metta
(risk_score (volatility > 0.10) => "HIGH")
(risk_score (liquidity_ratio < 0.3) => "MEDIUM")
```
This ensures every decision has explainability and provenance.

| `/infra` | Deployment setup and environment configs |
| `/scripts` | Orchestration scripts (`run_all.sh` to start all agents and backend) |

## 🧪 Example API Usage

### ➤ Portfolio Summary

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/portfolio_summary
```
Response:
```bash
{
  "assets": [
    {"symbol": "PYUSD", "fraction": 0.4, "volatility": 0.01, "liquidity_ratio": 0.9}
  ],
  "aggregates": {"volatility": 0.16}
}
```

### ➤ Execute Transaction

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"proposal": {"rebalance_to": "USDC"}, "reason": "reduce volatility"}'
```
Response:
```bash
{
  "signed_tx": "0xdeadbeefcafebabe",
  "status": "simulated",
  "proposal": {"rebalance_to": "USDC"},
  "reason": "reduce volatility"
}
```

## 🧠 How the AI Works

### 🔹 Step 1 — Data Ingestion
The **backend** aggregates real-time DeFi data and distributes it to all active agents for reasoning and collaboration.  
This ensures that every agent operates with synchronized market data, portfolio states, and user-defined constraints.

### 🔹 Step 2 — Symbolic Reasoning
The **`risk_agent`** leverages **MeTTa** (from SingularityNET) to reason over symbolic rules defined in `rules.json`.  
Using MeTTa’s structured logic and pattern-matching capabilities, it produces **explainable, human-readable reasoning traces** for its risk decisions.

**Example MeTTa rule logic**
```metta
(risk_score (volatility > 0.10) => "HIGH")
(risk_score (liquidity_ratio < 0.3) => "MEDIUM")
(risk_score (stablecoin > 0.5) => "LOW")
```

### 🔹 Step 3 — Multi-Agent Collaboration

The **`coordinator_agent`** acts as the communication bridge between all other agents.  
It requests inputs from the **`risk_agent`** and **`yield_agent`**, merges their outputs, and formulates a unified decision proposal.  
This collaborative reasoning allows **NeuraDEX** to provide **dynamic, adaptive, and transparent DeFi strategies** that evolve intelligently with market conditions.

### 🔹 Step 4 — Execution

The **`execution_agent`** simulates secure transaction signing and proposal submission through the backend’s `/api/execute` endpoint.  
This agent ensures that all transaction recommendations are **verified, logged, and auditable**, maintaining safety, reproducibility, and compliance with decentralized financial standards.
